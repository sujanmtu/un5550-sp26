    "We will cover (as per the textbook) the frequentist approach, using frequentist measures like $p$-values and confidence intervals.  This has been the dominant approach to conducting hypothesis testing over the last two decades.  I do want to take a few minutes to talk about the Bayesian approach, since more recently, the Bayesian inference (MA 5770) has been garnering enthusiasm in fields like machine learning.  Bayesian inference uses the idea of conditional probability (e.g. P(A|B): probability that event A happens given event B) to determine which hypothesis is most probable.  One has to specify a prior distribution  about the probability distribution that represents the statistic one cares about.  To use Bayesian inference, one needs a full understanding of the statistical model.  Lets return to the frequentist approach for hypothesis testing.\n",
